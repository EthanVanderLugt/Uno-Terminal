# Uno-Terminal
A simple text game that replicates the popular card game.

Players are tasked to accosicate numbers with cards as if they were physically real. All of the usual cards are present, however there are certain rule changes compared to the original UNO card game...

1. UNO is assumed to be called once a player reaches a single card
2. Players are punished for making illegal moves by being forced to draw two cards (even if there are no legal cards they can play.
3. No +2 or +4 cards as of now.
